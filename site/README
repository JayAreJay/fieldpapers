This is where all the public-facing web stuff goes.

The www folder is where your document root should point, everything else
is not for public consumption. Note the Makefile, which creates a tmp folder
for temporary files and a templates/cache folder for use by Smarty.

You'll want to run `make` before you do anything else.
